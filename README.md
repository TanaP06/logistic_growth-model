\## What This Project Does



The model simulates:



\-  \*\*User Growth\*\*

&nbsp; - Logistic (sigmoid) growth over time

&nbsp; - Market saturation behavior

\-  \*\*Revenue Generation\*\*

&nbsp; - Freemium monetization model

&nbsp; - Premium conversion rate

&nbsp; - Monthly subscription pricing

\-  \*\*Cost Structure\*\*

&nbsp; - Infrastructure costs with economies of scale

&nbsp; - Storage costs per user

&nbsp; - Development, MVP, and operational costs

\-  \*\*Profit \& Break-Even Analysis\*\*

&nbsp; - Yearly profit over time

&nbsp; - Automatic detection of break-even year

&nbsp; - Visualization of revenue vs. costs
